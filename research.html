        <summary>About get and post values in method attribute in forms</summary>
        <p>The GET method sends form data appended to the URL as query parameters, making the data visible in the URL itself. This method is useful when the action does not alter the server's state, such as in search forms or when the results need to be bookmarked. However, it is important to note that GET is limited by URL length restrictions, which means itâ€™s only suitable for small amounts of data. For example, in a search form where a user enters a query, submitting the form would result in a URL like /search?query=example, with the data clearly visible.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the POST method sends form data in the body of the HTTP request rather than in the URL. This approach is more secure for transmitting sensitive information, such as passwords or personal details, and can also handle larger amounts of data without the constraints of URL length. POST is typically used for forms that modify the server's data, such as user registration, login forms, or any action that updates the database. When using POST, the form data is not exposed in the URL, offering better protection for sensitive information.</p>

        <summary>why we use meta name="view"?</summary>
        <p>The <meta name="viewport"> tag helps ensure that a website is displayed correctly on all devices, especially mobile devices. It allows you to set the width and scaling of the viewport so that it's the right size for the device's screen. Without this tag, the content on a mobile device might be too small or squeezed to fit, making it difficult to read.
